# **Common Requirements**
For some guidance and reference to the step-by-step programming, I have the following parts of requirements to achieve the desired result for these codes.



# **---Definition**

*    **Part 1: Data Preprocessing**

     Data preprocessing in Google Colab involves importing your dataset, handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling features to ensure uniformity. These steps are essential for cleaning and transforming raw data into a format suitable for analysis or machine learning models.
*    **Part 2: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
      Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) in Google Colab involves visually and statistically examining your dataset to understand its underlying structure and relationships between variables. Through techniques like summary statistics, data visualization, and correlation analysis, EDA helps uncover patterns, outliers, and potential insights that guide further data preprocessing and modeling decisions.
*    **Part 3: Linear Regression Model (Predicting Monthly Revenue)**
      In Google Colab, building a linear regression model to predict monthly revenue typically involves importing libraries like scikit-learn, loading and preprocessing the dataset, splitting it into training and testing sets, fitting the model to the training data, and evaluating its performance using metrics like mean squared error or R-squared. This process allows you to create a predictive model that estimates monthly revenue based on input features such as advertising spend, website traffic, or other relevant factors.
*    **Part 4: Logistic Regression Model (Predicting Customer Feedback)**
     In Google Colab, constructing a logistic regression model to predict customer feedback involves importing necessary libraries like scikit-learn, preprocessing the data, splitting it into training and testing sets, fitting the logistic regression model to the training data, and assessing its performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, or F1-score. This enables the creation of a predictive model that categorizes customer feedback into positive or negative classes based on features such as product ratings, sentiment analysis, or customer demographics.
*    **Part 5: Comparative Analysis and Visualization**
      In Google Colab, performing a comparative analysis and visualization involves importing libraries like matplotlib or seaborn for data visualization, and pandas for data manipulation. By comparing different datasets or models through graphical representations such as histograms, box plots, or line charts, you can gain insights into trends, distributions, or performance differences, aiding in decision-making and interpretation of results.
